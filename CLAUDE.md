# claudia — development guidelines

## What this project is

**claudia** — Claude Introspective Analysis.

A CLI tool that reads Claude Code's local session logs (`~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl`)
to report token usage, estimated cost, and environmental impact. Intended to grow into a
broader suite of Claude self-analysis and observability tools.

The installed binary lives on `PATH` (`~/.local/bin/claudia` via `uv tool install
--editable .`, or `/usr/local/bin/claudia` where that's writable). The source is the
single file `claudia.py` at the repo root (`.py` extension required for Python
packaging).

## Design constraints

- **stdlib only** — no third-party dependencies. `claudia` must run with the system Python
  (`/usr/bin/python3`) without a virtualenv. Every import must be from the standard library.
- **Single file** — the entire tool is `claudia.py`. At ~870 lines it is approaching the
  split threshold — consider extracting Admin API helpers if the file grows further.
- **No auth by default** — the core reporting commands read local files only. The `--verify`
  command is the only path that touches the network, and it requires an explicit env var.
- **Offline-first** — all estimates (cost, energy, water, carbon) are computed locally from
  the JSONL data. No telemetry, no callbacks.

## Adding a new command

1. Add a `cmd_<name>(entries, args)` function
2. Add a `--<name>` argument to the argparse block in `main()`
3. Wire it into the dispatch block in `main()`
4. Write an ADR in `docs/decisions/` if the approach involves a non-obvious design choice
5. Add the task to `tasks/todo.md` as `[x]` when shipped

## Work tracking

One issue per discrete piece of work; milestones group time-boxed or phased
efforts; `tasks/todo.md` is the local record (ADR + issue links). For
cross-repo or multi-machine phases, use a GitHub Project board. Full guidance:
`docs/filing-issues.md` → "How work is tracked here".

**Closing issues** — always with evidence, never silently:

- Work that lands as a change → `Closes #N` (one keyword per issue) in the PR
  description, or in the commit body above the trailers when there is no PR.
  `Refs #N` for partial work. The same change updates `tasks/todo.md`.
- Anything no commit will close (superseded, obsolete, duplicate, already
  fixed) → close by triage with a comment naming what landed and where:
  `gh issue close N -r completed -c "<commit/ADR/CHANGELOG + file path>"`.
  Use `-r "not planned"` for duplicates, obsolete items, and won't-do.
- Never close an issue whose governing ADR is still `Proposed` — flip the ADR
  first. Sweep the open list at each release, CHANGELOG entry, or phase end.

Full guidance: `docs/filing-issues.md` → "Closing issues".

## Coding standards

- Python 3.10+. Use `match` where it reads better than `if/elif` chains.
- Type hints on all function signatures. No `Any`.
- Format strings over concatenation.
- Constants at the top of the file in ALL_CAPS — update them when sources change.
- Every estimate shown to the user must cite its source inline (comment or note in output).

## Updating constants

Environmental and pricing constants live at the top of `claudia`:

| Constant | Source | When to update |
|---|---|---|
| `PRICING` | Anthropic pricing page | Model price changes |
| `ENERGY_J` | TokenPowerBench / Luccioni et al. 2023 | New hardware benchmarks |
| `WATER_L_PER_KWH` | Li et al. 2023 | Significant WUE improvements |
| `CARBON_KG_PER_KWH` | EPA / Ember annual grid report | Annually |

After updating constants, reinstall so the `claudia` on `PATH` picks up the change
(run from the repo root):
```bash
uv tool install --editable .   # symlinked entry point — usually no-op
cp claudia.py /usr/local/bin/claudia  # if installed there instead
```

## Verifying against the Anthropic Admin API

```bash
# Org-wide
ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY=sk-ant-admin... claudia --verify

# Filtered to your key (find ID at console.anthropic.com → API Keys)
ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY=sk-ant-admin... claudia --verify --api-key-id apikey_01Abc...
```

Requires an Admin API key — not a regular user key. See ADR-003.

## ADRs

Read `docs/decisions/` before changing the data source, estimation methodology, or
API integration approach. Key decisions:

- ADR-001: Read local JSONL rather than making API calls for core reporting
- ADR-002: Environmental impact estimation sources and methodology
- ADR-003: Anthropic Admin API for cross-verification
- ADR-006: Coder session index (`claudia index`) — agent-agnostic per-session
  token ledger; read it before touching the ledger schema or counting logic

### Chat loop workflow for ADR decisions

When working on design decisions, chat loops should:
1. Reference existing ADRs before proposing new approaches
2. Document evidence by filing issues (see `docs/filing-issues.md`)
3. Cross-reference issues and ADRs for traceability
4. Update `tasks/todo.md` with findings

See `docs/filing-issues.md` → "ADR decision points and chat loops" for full guidance.

## Git workflow

- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`
- Every commit carries `Coding-Agent:` (`claude`, `opencode`, or `manual`) and
  `Model:` trailers via the `prepare-commit-msg` hook. Install it in a repo
  with `claudia --install-git-hook [PATH]`. See ADR-007 and
  `docs/agent-tagging.md`.
- After any change to `claudia.py`, copy to `/usr/local/bin/claudia`
- Do not commit API keys or Admin keys
